# SD4ED

SD4ED (Sequence Diagram Tool for Education) is an online educational tool developed to allow creating a valid sequence diagram with instant feedback. SD4ED helps with learning to draw a sequence diagram (SD) by providing Hints and Feedback. SD4ED provides several scenarios and a UML class diagram for each. Every step during the SD construction is assisted with feedback to help check the classes, objects, methods and whether the SD is complete or not for each specified scenario. Additionally, qualitative feed-back and scores are given based on design submitted. Users are allowed to improve their scores by resubmitting the design.
